## Who am I?

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pietro Marino. a Self taught (passionate) web developers from Italy.

Currenctly i work as full stack developer with this main technology:
- back end: Node.js (Typescript)
- front end: React.js

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all aspects of a webapp, from front-end to the devops. Because i want to be able to handle it, to select the correct solution for the case and so on.
Also i'm search for new technologies and/or libraries to improve my skills and job.

When i'm not working I like to go hiking in the mountains, play video games, read few books.
